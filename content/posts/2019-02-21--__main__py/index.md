We have all seen the `__init__.py` file and know its role, but what is `__main__.py`? I have seen many Python projects either on Github or at work that do not take advantage of this magic file. In my opinion, including a `__main__.py` is a better way to interface with multi-file python modules.

But first some background: How do most people run their Python programs?
Occasionally you will write a program that is organized enough so that it can both be imported as a module to another program or run by itself through a command line interface. In this case, you are probably familiar with the following lines commonly placed at the bottom of the file:

```python
if __name__ == __main__:
  main(sys.argv)
```

When you run a program by calling the Python interpreter on it, the magic global variable `__name__` gets set to `__main__`. We can use that to know that we are not being imported as a module, but ran. For example:

python myapp.py
This works just fine for single file projects.

The problem
If you are like me, you do not want your entire application in a single python file. Separating related logic out into their own files makes for easier editing and maintainability. For example:

```sh
.
├── README.me
├── requirements.txt
├── setup.py
└── src
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── client.py
    ├── logic.py
    ├── models.py
    └── run.py
```

But then this raises confusion to a user who just downloaded your program. Which one is the main file? Is it run.py? Or maybe client.py? What file has my precious if `__name__ == __main__` statement? This is where we can get a lot of value from `__main__.py`.

**main**.py
The magic file **main**.py is called when you run your project with the -m module flag. If you code is intended to be used a module first, and command line interface second, this makes perfect sense to use. Think of it as a place we can put whatever would be in our body of our if `__name__ == __main__` statement. Refactoring the project above to conform:

```sh
.
├── README.me
├── requirements.txt
├── setup.py
└── myapp
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── __main__.py
    ├── client.py
    ├── logic.py
    ├── models.py
```

And now we just run it as a module not a singleton program.

```python
python -m myapp
```

`__main__.py` will auto-magically be executed. This is a perfect place to put a command line interface and handle program arguments!

Good luck and happy hacking!
